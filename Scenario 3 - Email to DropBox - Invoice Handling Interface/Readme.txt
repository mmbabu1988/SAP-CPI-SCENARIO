Business Requirement Details
============================

Description: 
We need to streamline and modernize our invoice processing operations at OOBEA Corporation. By automating the extraction of invoices from email attachments (PDF, XML and ZIP) and securely storing them in Dropbox, we aim to significantly reduce manual data entry, enhance accuracy, and expedite the accounts payable process. This integration not only improves efficiency but also ensures compliance with financial regulations while accommodating our global supplier network's diverse invoice formats. The inclusion of an error handling mechanism further minimizes the risk of overlooking invoices, allowing our finance team to maintain control and efficiency in handling incoming invoices, thereby supporting our organization's financial health and growth objectives. 

Rationale: 
The rationale is to automate invoice processing, reduce manual efforts, and enhance accuracy by implementing the SAP CPI integration. This will streamline operations, ensure compliance, and improve efficiency, while the exception handling mechanism will help maintain control and support our organization's financial growth.
