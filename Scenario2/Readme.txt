Real Time SAP CPI Scenario 2:
File to File - Order Data Conversion and Integration

Description: 
As a fundamental business requirement within the Order to Cash process, we must establish a seamless integration mechanism between our e-commerce system and partner systems that operate with diverse data formats, including JSON and CSV. This integration necessitates the conversion of order data from XML format to meet the specific data format requirements of Partner System A (CSV) and Partner System B (JSON), with simultaneous data transmission to both partners. Equally crucial is the implementation of a robust data quality validation procedure for incoming XML data; any data failing validation must be identified and logged in an Error File Database for subsequent processing by our quality assurance team. 

Rationale: 
By implementing this integration scenario, the e-commerce system can fulfil the partner system requirement by converting the XML order data into different formats (JSON, CSV). This requirement is essential to ensure efficient and error-free interactions with our partner systems, ultimately enhancing our Order to Cash workflow.
